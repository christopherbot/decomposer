# Decomposed

:mushroom: :musical_keyboard:

Decomposed is a music creation game where pesky bugs will try to ruin your composition.

You can save up to two songs to your local storage and load them later for playback.

It was created with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/) for the [GitHub Game Off 2021](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021).
