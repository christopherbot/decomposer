## Game

Decomposer is a music creation game where pesky bugs will try to ruin your composition.

The game is recommended to be played at a minimum width of 1000px.

Enable Creative Mode to prevent new bugs from appearing so you can write your song at your own pace.

Enable Pentatonic Mode to prevent placing half-step notes that create dissonance. If you have never written music before, this might help your song sound more pleasant.

You can save up to two songs to your local storage and load them later for playback.
